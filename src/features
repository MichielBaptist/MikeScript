Features:

1. tuple unpacking (very difficult)

1, 2, 3 => t1;
"hello", "world" => t2;

*t1, *t2 >>= f;

Need to "flatten" tuple structure and replace with a flat list.
Evaltuple then needs to:
1. evaluate all elements in the tuple
2. Check all values, if they are starred (*) tuples then unpack

2. indexing (very easy)
1, 2, 3 => t1;

t1[0] >>= print;
t1[1] >>= print;
t1[2] >>= print;

Add a unary operator

primary ->
    postfix

postfix ->
    base postfix_tail*

postfix_tail ->
  | '[' expression ']'

3. Add lists (easy I think)
4. Add structs (not sure)
5. Add lambdas if needed
